# Repository for my dotties.

Trying to keep my files up-to-date as possible, because  
No one never knows when your computer fades away.

**Common applications I use:**  
- fm: ranger  
- video: mpv  
- image: sxiv  
- irc: weechat
- menu: dmenu
- clip: xcmenu
- wm: herbstluftwm  
- web: qutebrowser  
- clock: wallclock  
- panel: bar + panel.sh  
- music: mpd+lolimpd+ncmpcpp  

**Edited and bundled screenshot to remind me how my setup looks:**
