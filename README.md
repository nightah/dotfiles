###Treasure Box of Wonders

__Introduction:__

Repository for my dotfiles. I'm planning to keep these settings as up-to-date as possible. In the near future I'll be setting stow up as well, so people can install my dotfiles with ease. Feel free to comment and use my files for your own greedy needs.

__About my setup__:

I tend to configure with settings a lot. I've been a hardcore herbstluftwm user for a bit over two years. I've tried different window managers out along the way. I fell in love with 2bwm not too long time ago and I have been on its 3bwm branch for a while. Mainly I love to live inside a terminal world so I rarely use anything that is graphical. 

#####Applications:
- __menu:__ dmenu
- __panel:__ lemonbar 
- __text editor:__ vim
- __image viewer:__ sxiv
- __composition:__ compton
- __terminal:__ urxvt/termite
- __window manager:__ 2bwm/herbstluftwm
- __music:__ mpd+ncmpcpp+lolimpd/deadbeef
- __internet browser:__ qutebrowser/firefox
- __file manager:__ coretools/ranger/spacefm

#####TODO:
- [ ] Set stow up!
