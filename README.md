###Treasure Box of Wonders

Repository for my dotfiles. I'm planning to keep these settings as up-to-date as possible. In the near future I'll be setting stow up as well, so people can install my dotfiles with ease.

**Applications:**
- **text editor:** vim
- **panel:** lemonbar
- **terminal:** urxvt/termite
- **window manager:** 2bwm/herbstluftwm
- **music:** mpd+ncmpcpp+lolmpd/deadbeef
- **file manager:** coretools/ranger/spacefm
